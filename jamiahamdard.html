        The history of Jamia Hamdard begins with the establishment of a small Unani clinic in the year 1906 by Hakeem
        Hafiz Abdul Majeed, one of the well-known practitioners of Unani System of Medicine of his time. Hakeem Hafiz
        Abdul Majeed had a vision of making the practice of Unani Medicine into a scientific discipline so that Unani
        medicines could be dispensed in a more efficacious manner to patients. He gave the name “Hamdard” to his venture
        which means “sympathy for all and sharing of pain”. His illustrious son, Hakeem Abdul Hameed, carried forward
        the philosophy and objectives of Hamdard in independent India. Even at the time of partition of India in 1947,
        Hakeem Abdul Hameed was dreaming of setting up a complex of educational institutions which would concentrate on
        highlighting the contribution of Islam and Islamic culture to Indian civilization and development of Unani
        medicines for curing diseases On 22 Shawwal, 1367 Hijri, corresponding to 28th August, 1948, Hamdard, which was
        a commercial enterprise at that time, was converted into a Wakf, with the object of giving effect to Islamic
        teachings of public charity including health and education. In 1964, Hamdard National Foundation was created
        with a view to receive and disburse the profits earned by Hamdard (Wakf) Laborator.
